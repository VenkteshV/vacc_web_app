By taking this simple pledge and sharing with your friends, you are helping build a conversation around getting vaccinated and encouraging more people to get vaccinated.
While we are already hearing this from our government, health experts, and news media... the Oosi Podu pledge hopes to use the power of friendship and social media to help reach 40 Lakh vaccinations in our city.
